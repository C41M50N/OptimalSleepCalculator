## Design Patterns
- Page Oriented Design, where business logic, ui state, and ui components all live in the page | [branch](https://github.com/Chuckinator2020/OptimalSleepCalculator/tree/master)
- Domain Driven Design (Clean Architecture); where business logic lives in the domain layer, ui state is contained in a view model, and ui components live in the presentation layer | [branch](https://github.com/Chuckinator2020/OptimalSleepCalculator/tree/clean-architecture)
